  "why_to_be_a_mentor": "I started as a developer in 2010, mainly focused on JavaScript and PHP, and living a lot of changes in this world. Now I'm focused on JavaScript, thanks to NodeJS to appear to this world! So I can help a lot with the projects using this tech, backend (NodeJS) or frontend (ReactJS). I worked for this few last years in companies developing purely JavaScript and also working with microservices. I'm really motivated to be a mentor because I enjoy taking a look at new projects, new ideas and see how they are growing! And also being a mentor, not just I can help you, I help me to know what is in the market now!",
